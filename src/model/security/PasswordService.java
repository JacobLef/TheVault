/**
 * Provides secure password hashing and verification services. Ensures that user passwords are
 * never stored in plaintext by applying cryptographic hashing algorithms with salt for enhanced
 * security.
 *
 * <p>
 *   All password operations use industry-standard hashing techniques to protect user credentials
 *   from unauthorized access, even in the event of data breaches. The service handles both
 *   password encoding during user registration and password verification during authentication
 *   attempts.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   This interface abstracts the underlying cryptographic implementation, allowing for different
 *   hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, scyrpt, Argon2) to be used polymorphically.
 * </p>
